We show that financial market segmentation and the household&apos;s endogenous portfolio reallocation are crucial features to properly understand the effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchase programs and other unconventional policies.'

We show that financial market segmentation and the household&apos;s endogenous portfolio reallocation are crucial features to properly understand the effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchase programs and other unconventional policies.
