2023-11-01	work_in_progress		"Gender Gap, Structural Change and Female Comparative Advantage: A Quantitative Analysis of China"		"This paper presents a theoretical framework to reconcile the declining female labor force participation (FLFP) rate and the diverging gender gap in workforce participation in China with the expansion of the service sector and with the increasing female comparative advantage in the market sectors. We argue that two factors jointly shape the trajectory of FLFP rate and gender gap in labor force participation: (i) the interaction between structural change and female comparative advantage dynamics, and (ii) the change of female comparative advantage in the market sectors relative to home production. The framework predicts that FLFP rate drops when women have comparative advantage in diminishing sectors and vice versa, and that a rise in female comparative advantage in the market sectors narrows gender differences in labor force participation."

2023-11-01	working_paper	submitted	"Self-fulfilling Volatility, Risk-Premium, and Business Cycles"		"This paper demonstrates that in macroeconomic models with nominal rigidities, a global solution exists that supports an alternate equilibrium where traditional Taylor rules give rise to self-fulfilling aggregate volatility and excess risk-premium. Within the rational expectations framework, we establish that individually optimal, path-dependent consumption strategies can generate endogenous volatility in a self-fulfilling manner, propelling the entire economy into crises (booms) characterized by elevated (reduced) aggregate risk. This outcome stems from the inability of traditional policy rules to target the expected return on aggregate wealth, which comprises not only the policy rate but also the market risk-premium; the latter ultimately determining the degree of households' intertemporal substitution. We then propose a ""generalized"" Taylor rule that targets both risk-premium and asset prices, and outline the necessary conditions to reestablish determinacy and attain what we term as the ultra-divine coincidence: the simultaneous stabilization of inflation, output gap, and the risk-premium."

2023-11-01	working_paper	submitted	"Efficiency, Risk and the Gains from Trade in Interbank Markets"		"We propose a model of the financial sector that captures complex relationships between highly heterogeneous agents in the market for loanable interbank funds and develops the bank-to-bank component of the macroeconomics financial transmission channel. Financial institutions trade funds due to heterogeneous capacity to provide liquidity, but trade is subject to frictions and uncertainty. The model provides a tractable framework to study the trade-off between efficiency and volatility in the financial sector, and its contribution to business cycles fluctuations."

2023-11-01	policy_paper		e-HKD Pilot Programme		"The e-HKD Pilot Programme is a key component of the HKMA's three-rail approach in paving the way for a possible implementation of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC). The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency. HSBC and HKUST constructed a one-week pilot on the HKUST campus, which included 148 students and 5 merchants."

2016-11-01	published_paper		Infrequent but long-lived zero lower bound episodes and the optimal rate of inflation	Annual Review of Economics	"Countries rarely hit the zero lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates, but when they do, these episodes tend to be very long-lived. These two features are difficult to incorporate jointly into macroeconomic models using typical representations of shock processes. We introduce a regime-switching representation of risk premium shocks into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model to generate a realistic distribution of ZLB durations. We discuss what different calibrations of this model imply for optimal inflation rates."
