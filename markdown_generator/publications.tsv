2023-11-01	"Gender Gap, Structural Change and Female Comparative Advantage: A Quantitative Analysis of China."	Working Paper	"This paper presents a theoretical framework to reconcile the declining female labor force participation (FLFP) rate and the diverging gender gap in workforce participation in China with the expansion of the service sector and with the increasing female comparative advantage in the market sectors. We argue that two factors jointly shape the trajectory of FLFP rate and gender gap in labor force participation: (i) the interaction between structural change and female comparative advantage dynamics, and (ii) the change of female comparative advantage in the market sectors relative to home production. The framework predicts that FLFP rate drops when women have comparative advantage in diminishing sectors and vice versa, and that a rise in female comparative advantage in the market sectors narrows gender differences in labor force participation."

2023-11-01	A Unified Theory of the Term-Structure and Monetary Stabilization.	Working Paper	We develop a New-Keynesian framework that incorporates the term-structure of financial markets and an active role for government and central bank’s balance sheet size and composition. We show that financial market segmentation and the household’s endogenous portfolio reallocation are crucial features to properly understand the effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchase programs and other unconventional policies.

2023-11-01	"Self-fulfilling Volatility, Risk-Premium, and Business Cycles."	Working Paper	"We develop a New-Keynesian framework with stock markets that features the potential for self-fulfilling financial uncertainty shocks. We show that conventional monetary policy rules are unable to prevent the appearance of financial sunspots, and describe the necessary conditions that restore determinacy and achieve ultra-divine coincidence: the joint stabilization of inflation, output gap, and risk-premium. We also revisit the zero lower bound (ZLB) and show it amplifies the duration, severity, and welfare costs of fluctuations in financial volatility."	"Joo Lee, Seung, and Marc Dordal i Carreras.

2023-11-01	"Effciency, Risk and the Gains from Trade in Interbank Markets."	Working Paper	"We propose a model of the financial sector that captures complex relationships between highly heterogeneous agents in the market for loanable interbank funds and develops the bank-to-bank component of the macroeconomics financial transmission channel. Financial institutions trade funds due to heterogeneous capacity to provide liquidity, but trade is subject to frictions and uncertainty. The model provides a tractable framework to study the trade-off between efficiency and volatility in the financial sector, and its contribution to business cycles fluctuations."

2016-11-01	Infrequent but long-lived zero lower bound episodes and the optimal rate of inflation.	Annual Review of Economics	"Countries rarely hit the zero lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates, but when they do, these episodes tend to be very long-lived. These two features are difficult to incorporate jointly into macroeconomic models using typical representations of shock processes. We introduce a regime-switching representation of risk premium shocks into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model to generate a realistic distribution of ZLB durations. We discuss what different calibrations of this model imply for optimal inflation rates."	"Dordal i Carreras, Marc, Olivier Coibion, Yuriy Gorodnichenko, and Johannes Wieland.
