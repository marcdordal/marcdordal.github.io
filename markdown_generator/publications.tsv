Surveys conducted before and after participants used the prototype revealed initially positive attitudes, with perceptions shifting significantly after the experience, particularly regarding security, ease of use, and promotional features. The findings highlight the importance of consumer perceptions, their susceptibility to change through exposure, and the need for cautious interpretation of survey data in this area."	"This study investigates the public's perception of retail central bank digital currency (rCBDC) and identifies the factors influencing its adoption. Conducted in collaboration with a prominent bank in Hong Kong, this research involved a hands-on experience with a prototype payment system making using of an e-HKD, being an rCBDC which could be implemented in Hong Kong. Participants' opinions on rCBDCs were assessed through surveys conducted before and after their engagement with the e-HKD pilot. Initially, participants displayed a broadly positive attitude towards rCBDC, although no single factor emerged as a decisive influence on their adoption decision. However, the pilot experience statistically significantly altered perceptions, particularly regarding security, ease of payment, and promotional functions, thereby impacting their willingness to adopt rCBDC. This study underscores the importance of understanding consumer perceptions and suggests that these perceptions are subject to change through exposure to regulatory information campaigns, prototype experiences, and initial models. Consequently, the study recommends a cautious approach to interpreting the reliability of existing survey findings in this domain."

Financial institutions trade funds due to heterogeneous capacity to provide liquidity, but trade is subject to frictions and uncertainty. The model provides a tractable framework to study the trade-off between efficiency and volatility in the financial sector, and its contribution to business cycles fluctuations."

We show that central banks can reduce excess volatility by credibly pledging future stabilization, or alternatively, by withholding such pledges to direct the economy toward favorable outcomes with lower volatility, revealing a trade-off. We also find that partial uncertainty about future policy dominates strict commitments. Finally, fiscal measures that promote risky asset investments can boost economic activity at the ZLB by increasing aggregate household financial wealth."	"This paper presents a model of the business cycle that incorporates financial markets and endogenous financial volatility at the Zero Lower Bound (ZLB). Within this framework, forward guidance is identified as a crucial mechanism for coordinating the actions of market participants, guiding the economy towards optimal equilibrium paths with lower financial volatility and enhanced welfare. We reveal three novel insights: (i) Central banks, by credibly pledging future economic stabilization, can mitigate excess financial market volatility at the ZLB; (ii) Alternatively, a central bank's commitment not to stabilize the economy in the future can direct the economy towards more favorable equilibrium paths with reduced endogenous volatility at the ZLB, presenting a trade-off between future business cycle stabilization and reduced financial volatility at the ZLB; (iii) Retaining some degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future stabilization plans strictly dominates other forms of forward guidance commitments. Finally, an examination of alternative fiscal policies reveals that measures encouraging increased investment in risky assets can stimulate economic activity at the ZLB by positively impacting aggregate household financial wealth."

Our model accounts for microfounded market segmentation across asset classes and maturities based on finite and estimable asset demand elasticities. We show that unconventional policy interventions, such as large-scale asset purchase programs and yield-curve control policies, effectively stabilize the economy during normal periods and at the zero lower bound, albeit by extending ZLB episodes and reducing the efficacy of future short-term rate adjustments."

In these equilibria, conventional Taylor rules give rise to self-fulfilling aggregate volatility, propelling the economy into crises (booms) characterized by elevated (reduced) aggregate risk. This outcome stems from the inability of conventional rules to target the expected growth rate of output, which is determined not only by the policy rate but also by the strength of the precautionary savings channel. We propose a new policy rule that targets both conventional mandates and aggregate volatility, reestablishing determinacy and achieving full stabilization."

22/2/2025	working_paper	submitted	Endogenous Firm Entry and the Monetary Policy 'Room'		"We present a business cycle model featuring endogenous firm entry. Entry-induced short-run shifts in supply shape the economy's response to both supply and demand shocks. In particular, rising aggregate demand spurs entry, expanding supply and reinforcing demand through entrants' investment expenditures. Monetary policy influences both aggregate demand and the entry decisions of financially constrained firms, shaping cycle dynamics in economies with high entry potential. Equilibrium firm entry is characterized by the 'policy room', a sufficient statistic for monetary policy effectiveness in both the model and empirical data."

We argue that two factors jointly shape the trajectory of FLFP rate and gender gap in labor force participation: (i) the interaction between structural change and female comparative advantage dynamics, and (ii) the change of female comparative advantage in the market sectors relative to home production. The framework predicts that FLFP rate drops when women have comparative advantage in diminishing sectors and vice versa, and that a rise in female comparative advantage in the market sectors narrows gender differences in labor force participation."

Geographically localized panics result in the robust spillover outside the state borders where they originate, leading to moderately persistent credit contractions and the accumulation of liquid assets. We provide a tractable model illustrating a key trade-off: while interbank markets, e.g., the pyramidal reserve structure of the banking system during the National Banking Era, allow banks to access cheaper funding, they spread the effects of panics throughout the country as observed in the data."

11/1/2016	published_paper		Infrequent but long-lived zero lower bound episodes and the optimal rate of inflation	Annual Review of Economics	"Countries rarely hit the zero lower bound (ZLB) on interest rates, but when they do, these episodes tend to be very long-lived. These two features are difficult to incorporate jointly into macroeconomic models using typical representations of shock processes. We introduce a regime-switching representation of risk premium shocks into an otherwise standard New Keynesian model to generate a realistic distribution of ZLB durations. We discuss what different calibrations of this model imply for optimal inflation rates."
