We argue that two factors jointly shape the trajectory of FLFP rate and gender gap in labor force participation: (i) the interaction between structural change and female comparative advantage dynamics, and (ii) the change of female comparative advantage in the market sectors relative to home production. The framework predicts that FLFP rate drops when women have comparative advantage in diminishing sectors and vice versa, and that a rise in female comparative advantage in the market sectors narrows gender differences in labor force participation.\"\t\"This paper presents a theoretical framework to reconcile the declining female labor force participation (FLFP) rate and the diverging gender gap in workforce participation in China with the expansion of the service sector and with the increasing female comparative advantage in the market sectors.

Surveys conducted before and after participants used the prototype revealed initially positive attitudes, with perceptions shifting significantly after the experience, particularly regarding security, ease of use, and promotional features. The findings highlight the importance of consumer perceptions, their susceptibility to change through exposure, and the need for cautious interpretation of survey data in this area.\"\t\"This study investigates the public's perception of retail central bank digital currency (rCBDC) and identifies the factors influencing its adoption. Conducted in collaboration with a prominent bank in Hong Kong, this research involved a hands-on experience with a prototype payment system making using of an e-HKD, being an rCBDC which could be implemented in Hong Kong. Participants' opinions on rCBDCs were assessed through surveys conducted before and after their engagement with the e-HKD pilot. Initially, participants displayed a broadly positive attitude towards rCBDC, although no single factor emerged as a decisive influence on their adoption decision. However, the pilot experience statistically significantly altered perceptions, particularly regarding security, ease of payment, and promotional functions, thereby impacting their willingness to adopt rCBDC. This study underscores the importance of understanding consumer perceptions and suggests that these perceptions are subject to change through exposure to regulatory information campaigns, prototype experiences, and initial models. Consequently, the study recommends a cautious approach to interpreting the reliability of existing survey findings in this domain.\"\t\"Kohei Kawaguchi, Si Yuan Jin and Haicheng Guo\"\t\"Dordal i Carreras, Marc, Kohei Kawaguchi, Si Yuan Jin and Haicheng Guo. \"\"Consumer Perceptions and Willingness to Adopt rCBDCs Before and After the e-HKD Pilot.\"\"  <i>In Progress</i> (2024).\"\t\"Dordal i Carreras, Marc, Kohei Kawaguchi, Si Yuan Jin and Haicheng Guo\"\t<i>Working Paper</i> (2024).\tDKJG_eHKD_pilot\t\thttp://marcdordal.github.io/files/WP_rCBDC_Taste_and_Perception.pdf\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

We reveal three novel insights: (i) Central banks, by credibly pledging future economic stabilization, can mitigate excess financial market volatility at the ZLB; (ii) Alternatively, a central bank's commitment not to stabilize the economy in the future can direct the economy towards more favorable equilibrium paths with reduced endogenous volatility at the ZLB, presenting a trade-off between future business cycle stabilization and reduced financial volatility at the ZLB; (iii) Retaining some degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future stabilization plans strictly dominates other forms of forward guidance commitments.

In our framework, short-term supply shifts driven by new firm entries become a crucial factor in driving the economy's response to shocks, regardless of whether those shocks originate from the 'supply' or 'demand' blocks. Specifically, an uptick in aggregate demand triggers a cycle of increased firm entry, thereby enhancing aggregate supply and, in turn, further boosting demand through greater purchases of equipment by new entrants. Monetary policy becomes especially powerful, as it simultaneously impacts aggregate demand and the entry decisions of financially constrained firms. This effect is particularly noticeable in economies with a significant potential for new firm entries.  Our analytical approach characterizes equilibrium firm entry as a function of the 'policy room', a sufficient statistic related to the effectiveness of monetary policy interventions in both the model and the data.\"\t\"We present a model of business cycles with endogenous firm entry.

We demonstrate that the financial market segmentation and the household's endogenous portfolio reallocation are crucial features for accurately understanding the effects of Large-Scale Asset Purchase (LSAP) programs. Our micro-foundation based on imperfect information about expected discounted asset returns readily accommodates varying degrees of market segmentation across asset classes and maturities, based on estimable asset demand elasticities. The central bank's bond purchases across maturities serve as a major determinant of the level and slope of the term-structure, and yield-curve-control (YCC) policies that actively manipulate long-term yields are highly effective in terms of stabilization during both normal times and at the ZLB. However, YCC policies also increase the duration of ZLB episodes, consequently placing the central bank in a position where the short-term rate becomes a less useful policy tool.\"\t\"We develop a New-Keynesian framework that incorporates the term-structure of financial markets and emphasizes the active role of the government and central bank's balance sheet size and composition.
