We argue that two factors jointly shape the trajectory of FLFP rate and gender gap in labor force participation: (i) the interaction between structural change and female comparative advantage dynamics, and (ii) the change of female comparative advantage in the market sectors relative to home production. The framework predicts that FLFP rate drops when women have comparative advantage in diminishing sectors and vice versa, and that a rise in female comparative advantage in the market sectors narrows gender differences in labor force participation.\"\t\"Dordal i Carreras, Cassie Xiang. \"\"Gender Gap, Structural Change and Female Comparative Advantage: A Quantitative Analysis of China.\"\"  <i>Working Paper</i> (2023).\"\tDX_Gender_Gap\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",

The pilot programme enables HKMA's collaboration with the industry to examine innovative use cases and maximise Hong Kong's readiness for a potential e-HKD. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (HSBC) was one of the institutions selected to participate. Collaborating with the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), HSBC sought to explore possible e-HKD every-day payment use cases, focusing on programmability as a value-add feature of digital currency as well as payment rail efficiency.

These two features are difficult to incorporate jointly into macroeconomic models using typical representations of shock processes.
