We argue that two factors jointly shape the trajectory of FLFP rate and gender gap in labor force participation: (i) the interaction between structural change and female comparative advantage dynamics, and (ii) the change of female comparative advantage in the market sectors relative to home production. The framework predicts that FLFP rate drops when women have comparative advantage in diminishing sectors and vice versa, and that a rise in female comparative advantage in the market sectors narrows gender differences in labor force participation.\"\t\"This paper presents a theoretical framework to reconcile the declining female labor force participation (FLFP) rate and the diverging gender gap in workforce participation in China with the expansion of the service sector and with the increasing female comparative advantage in the market sectors.

In our framework, short-term supply shifts driven by new firm entries become a crucial factor in driving the economy's response to shocks, regardless of whether those shocks originate from the 'supply' or 'demand' blocks. Specifically, an uptick in aggregate demand triggers a cycle of increased firm entry, thereby enhancing aggregate supply and, in turn, further boosting demand through greater equipment purchases by new entrants. Monetary policy becomes especially powerful in this context, as it simultaneously impacts aggregate demand and the entry decisions of firms. This effect is particularly noticeable in economies with a significant potential for new firm entries. Our analytical approach characterizes the equilibrium of firm entry as a function of the 'policy room', a sufficient statistic related to monetary policy, which turns out to be positively correlated with the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy interventions.\"\t\"This paper presents a model of the business cycle that highlights the importance of endogenous firm entry.

In our framework, short-term supply shifts driven by new firm entries become a crucial factor in driving the economy&apos;s response to shocks, regardless of whether those shocks originate from the &apos;supply&apos; or &apos;demand&apos; blocks. Specifically, an uptick in aggregate demand triggers a cycle of increased firm entry, thereby enhancing aggregate supply and, in turn, further boosting demand through greater equipment purchases by new entrants. Monetary policy becomes especially powerful in this context, as it simultaneously impacts aggregate demand and the entry decisions of firms. This effect is particularly noticeable in economies with a significant potential for new firm entries.
