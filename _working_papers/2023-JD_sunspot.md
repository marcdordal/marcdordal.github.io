title: "Self-fulfilling Volatility and a New Monetary Policy"
excerpt: 'We demonstrate that macroeconomic models with nominal rigidities feature a global solution supporting an alternative equilibrium where traditional Taylor rules give rise to self-fulfilling aggregate volatility, propelling the economy into crises (booms) characterized by elevated (reduced) aggregate risk. This outcome stems from the inability of traditional policy rules to target the expected growth rate of aggregate output, which comprises not only the policy rate but also the precautionary savings channel; the latter ultimately determining the degree of households&apos; intertemporal substitution. We propose a new policy rule that targets both conventional mandates and aggregate volatility, reestablishing determinacy and attaining full stabilization.'
